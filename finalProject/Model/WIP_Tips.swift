//Rebalance once a year / nearing retirement / retired

//Need more clarification on:
//Rebalancing between taxable and tax-advantaged accounts, sell in a tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs to avoid taxes?
// But, if you have capital losses, sell in a taxable account?
//Collins rebalances annually, pick a date like your birthday
//Annual rebalance date: There isn't a prescribed time, other than avoiding the beginning and end of the year-at these times, the market may be skewed by more people buying and selling for tax reasons. Just pick a time to rebalance each year that's easy to remember, such as your birthday.

//Vanguard offers TRFs-Targeted Retirement Funds-which rebalance automatically.
