Harvard Business Review
 https://hbr.org/2017/05/what-sets-successful-ceos-apart

our most important discovery was that successful chief executives tend to demonstrate four specific behaviors that prove critical to their performance. We also found that when boards focus on those behaviors in their selection and development processes, they significantly increase their chances of hiring the right CEO. And our research and experience suggest that when leaders who aspire to the CEO‚Äôs office‚Äî87% of executives, according to a 2014 survey from Korn Ferry‚Äîdeliberately develop those behaviors, they dramatically raise the odds that they‚Äôll become high-performing chief executives.

 Roughly half the strong candidates (who had earned an A overall on a scale of A, B, or C) had distinguished themselves in more than one of the four essential behaviors, while only 5% of the weak candidates (who earned a B or C) had.


 1. Deciding with speed and conviction.
people who were described as ‚Äúdecisive‚Äù were 12 times more likely to be high-performing CEOs.

 Interestingly, the highest-IQ executives we coach, those who relish intellectual complexity, sometimes struggle the most with decisiveness. While the quality of their decisions is often good, because of their pursuit of the perfect answer, they can take too long to make choices or set clear priorities‚Äîand their teams pay a high price. These smart but slow decision makers become bottlenecks, and their teams either grow frustrated (which can lead to the attrition of valuable talent) or become overcautious themselves, stalling the entire enterprise. So it‚Äôs no surprise that when we looked more closely at the executives who were rated poor on decisiveness, we found that only 6% received low marks because they made decisions too quickly. The vast majority‚Äî94%‚Äîscored low because they decided too little, too late.

 Good CEOs realize that a wrong decision may be better than no decision at all.
 High-performing CEOs understand that a wrong decision is often better than no decision at all.
As former Greyhound CEO Stephen Gorman, who led the bus operator through a turnaround, told us, A bad decision was better than a lack of direction. Most decisions can be undone, but you have to learn to move with the right amount of speed.

Decisive CEOs recognize that they can‚Äôt wait for perfect information. ‚ÄúOnce I have 65% certainty around the answer, I have to make a call,‚Äù says Jerry Bowe, CEO of the private-label manufacturer Vi-Jon. But they do work actively to solicit multiple points of view and often poll a relatively small, carefully cultivated ‚Äúkitchen cabinet‚Äù of trusted advisers who can be counted on for unvarnished opinions and sound judgment.

Bowe motivates himself to act on decisions by framing things this way: ‚ÄúI ask myself two questions: First, what‚Äôs the impact if I get it wrong? And second, how much will it hold other things up if I don‚Äôt move on this?‚Äù

 But once a path is chosen, high-performing CEOs press ahead without wavering. Art Collins, former chairman and CEO of Medtronic, told us: ‚ÄúEmployees and other key constituencies will quickly lose faith in leaders who waffle or backtrack once a decision is made.‚Äù And if decisions don‚Äôt turn out well? Our analysis suggests that while every CEO makes mistakes, most of them are not lethal. We found that among CEOs who were fired over issues related to decision making, only one-third lost their jobs because they‚Äôd made bad calls; the rest were ousted for being indecisive.



 2. Engaging for impact.

  CEOs who deftly engaged stakeholders with this results orientation were 75% more successful in the role.

 When interacting with stakeholders, CEOs like Bell are acutely aware of how their moods and body language can affect the impact of their communications.
 Composure is a job requirement, and more than three-quarters of the strong CEO candidates in our sample demonstrated calm under pressure.

 skilled CEOs gain the support of their colleagues by instilling confidence that they will lead the team to success, even if that means making uncomfortable or unpopular moves. These CEOs do not shy away from conflict in the pursuit of business goals; in fact, in our analysis two-thirds of the CEOs who excelled at engagement were rated as strong in conflict management. The ability to handle clashing viewpoints also seems to help candidates advance to the CEO‚Äôs office. When we analyzed leaders who‚Äôd made it there significantly faster than average, one of the qualities that stood out was their willingness to engage in conflict.
CEOs who engage stakeholders do not invest their energy in being liked or protecting their teams from painful decisions.


 Consensus is good, but it‚Äôs too slow, and sometimes you end up with the lowest common denominator.
 When tackling contentious issues, leaders who are good at engagement give everyone a voice but not a vote. They listen and solicit views but do not default to consensus-driven decision making.

 It‚Äôs no coincidence that the careers of turnaround CEOs are frequently a series of lucrative two- to three-year stints; they put out the fires and then move on to the next assignment.



 3. Adapting proactively.

 Our analysis shows that CEOs who excel at adapting are 6.7 times more likely to succeed. CEOs themselves told us over and over that this skill was critical.
 When asked what differentiates effective CEOs, Dominic Barton, global managing partner of McKinsey & Company, immediately offered: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs dealing with situations that are not in the playbook. As a CEO you are constantly faced with situations where a playbook simply cannot exist. You‚Äôd better be ready to adapt.
Most CEOs know they have to divide their attention among short-, medium-, and long-term perspectives, but the adaptable CEOs spent significantly more of their time‚Äîas much as 50%‚Äîthinking about the long term. Other executives, by contrast, devoted an average of 30% of their time to long-term thinking. We believe a long-term focus helps because it makes CEOs more likely to pick up on early signals. Highly adaptable CEOs regularly plug into broad information flows: They scan wide networks and diverse sources of data, finding relevance in information that may at first seem unrelated to their businesses. As a result, they sense change earlier and make strategic moves to take advantage of it.
Adaptable CEOs also recognize that setbacks are an integral part of changing course and treat their mistakes as opportunities to learn and grow. In our sample, CEOs who considered setbacks to be failures had 50% less chance of thriving. Successful CEOs, on the other hand, would offer unabashedly matter-of-fact accounts of where and why they had come up short and give specific examples of how they tweaked their approach to do better next time. Similarly, aspiring CEOs who demonstrated this kind of attitude (what Stanford‚Äôs Carol Dweck calls a ‚Äúgrowth mindset‚Äù) were more likely to make it to the top of the pyramid: Nearly 90% of the strong CEO candidates we reviewed scored high on dealing with setbacks.



 4. Delivering reliably.

 Mundane as it may sound, the ability to reliably produce results was possibly the most powerful of the four essential CEO behaviors. In our sample, CEO candidates who scored high on reliability were twice as likely to be picked for the role and 15 times more likely to succeed in it. Boards and investors love a steady hand, and employees trust predictable leaders.
A stunning 94% of the strong CEO candidates we analyzed scored high on consistently following through on their commitments.
 A key practice here is setting realistic expectations up front. In their first weeks on the job reliable CEOs resist the temptation to jump into execution mode. They dig into budgets and plans, and engage with board members, employees, and customers to understand expectations. At the same time, they rapidly assess the business to develop their own point of view on what‚Äôs realistic and work to align expectations with that.

 CEOs who ranked high on reliability employed several other tactics as well. Three-quarters of them were rated strong on organization and planning skills. They established business management systems that included a cadence of meetings, dashboards of metrics, clear accountability, and multiple channels for monitoring performance and making rapid course corrections. Most important, they surrounded themselves with strong teams.

 Unfortunately, this was not true of all CEOs: The single most common mistake among first-time CEOs‚Äîcommitted by a surprisingly high 60% of them‚Äîwas not getting the right team in place quickly enough. For CEOs choosing talent, the stakes are high and the misses obvious. The successful ones move decisively to upgrade talent. They set a high bar and focus on performance relevant to the role rather than personal comfort or loyalty‚Äîtwo criteria that often lead to bad calls.

 the key ingredients: decisiveness, the ability to engage stakeholders, adaptability, and reliability.
 focusing on these essential behaviors will improve both a board‚Äôs likelihood of choosing the right CEO‚Äîand an individual leader‚Äôs chances of succeeding in the role.

 A study of munitions workers in the first world war found that their output per hour tended to decline once they spent over 50 hours a week toiling.
 The Institute for Employment Studies in Britain reviewed academic research on the subject and concluded that ‚Äúlong hours working [more than 48 hours a week] was associated with (but was not proved to cause) various negative effects, such as decreased productivity, poor performance, health problems, and lower employee motivation.

 long hours simply lead to wasted effort. work expands to fill the time available.

 The modern world is supposedly moving in a direction where routine tasks are automated, leaving the more creative processes to the humans

Meditation enabled me to cast off the many trivial worries that once possessed me and gain clarity about what was really important. I gradually became more self-aware and more sensitive to the impact I was having on others. The important thing is to have a set time each day to pull back from the intense pressures of leadership to reflect on what is happening.
