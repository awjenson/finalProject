/*
 QUOTES TO BE USED IN LATER VERSION:

 "People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things. I'm as proud of what we don't do as I am of what we do." - Steve Jobs

"All our life, so far as it has definite form, is but a mass of habits." - William James

 "Champions don't do extraordinary things. They do ordinary things, but they do them without thinking, too fast for the other team to react. They follow the habit they've learned." - Tony Dungy
