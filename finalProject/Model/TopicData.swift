Protein-rich foods keep you full longer than other foods because they take longer to leave the stomach. Also, protein keeps blood-sugar levels steady, which prevent spikes in hunger." , sourceName: "Benjamin P.

Ideas generally came while the person was at home, in transportation, or during recreational activity. âThe most creative ideas arenât going to come while sitting in front of your monitor,â says Scott Birnbaum, a vice president of Samsung Semiconductor. The reason for this is simple. When youâre working directly on a task, your mind is tightly focused on the problem at hand (i.e., direct reflection). Conversely, when youâre not working, your mind loosely wanders(i.e., indirect reflection)." , sourceName: "Benjamin P.
