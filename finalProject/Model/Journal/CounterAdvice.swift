 QUOTES TO BE USED IN LATER VERSION:

 “I am not a product of my circumstances. I am a product of my decisions.” Stephen R. Covey

 "Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant." Robert Louis Stevenson

"The way to be a better comic was to create better jokes and the way to create better jokes was to write every day. Don't break the chain. After a few days you'll have a chain. Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day. You'll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only job next is to not break the chain." Jerry Seinfeld
