Numerous studies now show that children exposed to households or classrooms near airplane flight paths, railways or highways are slower in their development of cognitive and language skills and have lower reading scores. The report concludes, citing children as particularly vulnerable to the effects of chronic urban and suburban racket. One study in New York City found that reading scores of sixth-grade students whose classrooms faced train tracks were a year behind those on the quieter side of the building. Researchers also found that the Munich students near the working airports had significantly higher levels of the stress hormones adrenaline and cortisol and markedly higher blood pressure readings than children in quieter neighborhoods. Evidence suggests that elevated blood pressure in childhood predicts higher blood pressure later in life, and higher levels of stress hormones are linked to several life-threatening adult illnesses, including high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol and other lipids, and heart disease. We think one thing that might be going on is that children who are exposed to noise develop a stress response of ignoring the noise, but not only do they ignore noise, there’s evidence that they also ignore speech. So not only are they ignoring the stimuli that are harmful, but they’re also ignoring stimuli that they need to pay attention to.", sourceName: "American Psychological Association", sourceURL: "https://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/07-08/silence.aspx", sponsorLogo: "", sponsorURL: "")

Children who had excessive screen time were failing to meet developmental milestones in language and communication, problem-solving, and fine and gross motor skills. When a child's days are consumed with screen time, they aren’t getting enough physical activity, which means they aren’t developing the motor skills they need to run, ride a bike, or throw a ball. \n\nFurthermore, a lot of the positive stimulation that helps kids with their physical and cognitive development comes from interactions with caregivers. But, when kids are in front of their screens, these important parent-child interactions aren’t happening, and this can delay or derail children’s development. \n\nCreate a family media plan. This involves controlling the number of hours spent in front of screens but it can also include establishing device-free zones (such as the dinner table) and baskets where everybody puts their devices at certain points of the day, to make room for family connection." , sourceName: "University of Calgary", sourceURL: "https://ucalgary.ca/utoday/issue/2019-01-28/excessive-screen-time-linked-preschool-learning-delays", sponsorLogo: "", sponsorURL: "")

It organizes what you see and what you don't see. It organizes your emotions and motivations. So, then you organize yourself around that aim. And then what happens is the day manifests itself as a set of challenges and problems. And if you solve them properly then you stay on the pathway towards that aim. And you can concentrate on the day. And it seems to me that that is what makes every moment of the day supercharged with meaning.
