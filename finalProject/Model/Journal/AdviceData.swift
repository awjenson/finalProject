You develop it to elicit information customers.", body: "The presentation summarizes your hypotheses about customers' problems, along with some potential solutions, so you can test whether your assumptions are correct. This presentation is your icebreaker when you meet customers. For a corporate presentation, consider a simple one-slide presentation. In this slide the list of the problems as you understand them go in column 1, today's solutions to the problems in column 2, and your company's solution in column 3. (In meetings with consumers where slides are inappropriate, a simple flip chart presentation will do.) \n\nRemember, though, \"presenting\" in this context really means inviting the customers' responses. So, after describing your assumed list of problems in column 1, pause and ask the customers what they think the problems are, whether you are missing any problems, and how they would rank-order the problems. What if a customer tells you the issues you thought were important realy aren't? Realize you've just obtained great data. While it may not be what you wanted to hear, it's wonderful to have that knowledge early on. Do not - I repeat, do not - try to \"convince\" customers they really have the problems you describe. They are the ones with the checkbooks, and you want them to convince you. If they agree with you about the problems, get them to explain why they think it is important to solve them (there is nothing better than playing validated customers needs back to them). Casually ask, \"How much does this problem cost you (in terms of lost revenue, lost customers, frustration, etc.\" today? What you are looking for is an understanding of how customers solve this problem today, or how they think others solve it. Ask who shares these problems? A set of people with common problems equals a common value proposition. Finally, for both corporate and consumer products, display your company's solution (not a set of features, but only the big idea) in column 3. Pause and watch the customers' reactions. Is the solution evident enough that they say \"Aha, if you could do that, all my problems would be solved?\" Alternatively, do they say, \"What do you mean?\" Then do they have to listen to you explain for 20 minutes and still not interested? Ask how your solution compares to the current solutions you just discussed. The point is not give a sales pitch. You want their reaction, and a discussion. \n\nMy favorite summary of this discussion is to ask two questions: \"What is the biggest pain in how you work? If you could wave a magic want and change anything in what you do, what would it be?\" I call these the \"IPO questions.\" Understand the answers to these questions and your startup is going public." , sourceName: "The Four Steps to the Epiphany: Successful Strategies for Products that Win, by Steve Blank", sourceURL: "https://www.amazon.com/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Successful-Strategies/dp/1119690358", doneBool: false, doneKey: "", buyURL: "https://www.amazon.com/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Successful-Strategies/dp/1119690358")

The goal has two parts: To reconfirm your product will solve a serious customer problem and to validate your product and its features.", body: "Along the way, you will further test your understanding of customers' pain, their workflow, and the organizational impact of your product. Develop a solution-oriented presentation that describes the product in terms of solving the customer's problem. If it's too early for a real product demo, the product presentation should cover the five (no more!) key product features. Include a story about \"life before your product\" and \"life after your product.\" Draw the customer' workflow or consumer's day with and without your product. Leave out all the marketing, positioning and fluff. Finally, detail the future of the product at least 18 months out, broken down into features by release. Rehearse how you will give this presentation to customers. Keep in mind you are not selling in this phase. Instead, you are trying to discover whether you have a salable product. You are gathering enough information so when you do try to sell something, you will be confident there is a group of customers who will buy. When your product presentation is ready, decide which customers you will visit. Get out of the building and talk to customers. You will get more information if you start by reminding your audience what problem your product is designed to solve. Describe why your company believes it is important to solve this problem. Pause here and see if you get agreement on the value of solving the problem. You should, since your presentation is based on what you've already learned from customers about their issues. With any luck, no surprises will pop up but if they do, go back to Phase 2. With agreement on the problem and its significance, you finally get to describe the product. Demonstrate the product if you can; even a prototype of a key concept can help a customer understand your solution. Pause here to gauge the customer's reaction. Next, draw the customer workflow with and without your product. Pause again to see if you get agreement on the \"before and after\" workflow. Describe who else in the customer's organization you believe your solution might affect. Listen here and see if you get agreement. The whole presentation should take no more than 20 minutes. Now it's time to listen. What are the customer's first reactions? Does your product solve a painful problem for them? Would the customers buy a product to solve this problem? Do they believe others in their company feel the same? How about in other companies? Ask about the features you've described. Do they match the customers; needs? What features must you have on day one? What features could wait until later? What features are simply missing? What is a \"complete product\" in the customer's mind? What other features are needed to move the product into the mainstream? Are third-party products or services needed to make your offering a mainstream product? Since your company will be spending a ton of money and lots of time trying to figure out how to position your product description, how do they think your product is different? Do they think you are creating a new market? Or do they think the product is a better version of an existing product (and, if so, better in what way)? Or do they shrug and say, \"It's somewhere in the middle, comparable to others, but it doesn't change the rules of the game\"? Check your hypotheses. What do customers think about your pricing? What do they think are comparable prices for this kind of product? When I found visionary customers who were truly interested in our products I would ask several questions to test the pricing boundaries. They included the IPO questions I mentioned earlier, the first of which was, \"Would you deploy our software enterprise-wide if it were free?\" I used this question to test the seriousness of a potential customer. If the customer wasn't ready to deploy the software even if it was free, then I was talking to the wrong person. When I found customers who would go through visualizing the pain of actually rolling out our product, I would ask them how they would deploy it, how many users would use it, what groups would get it first, what criteria would they use to measure its success, and so on. By the end of this visualization exercise I had potential customers who had mentally installed and deployed our software. Then I ask, \"Would you pay $1 million for our software?\" The answer was usually instructive. Suppose customers said, \"We couldn't see paying more than $250,000 for the first set of application.\" In their minds they had already bought the product and now the bill just came due. The first number out of their mouths usually was what they had in their immediate budget and would be the first purchase price. Once I got a first number, I always asked, \"How much more would you expect to pay for professional services (the customization and installation)?\" If they were still interested in brainstorming, I would push and see whether they would spend those dollars every year on our software. Then, I would ask, \"What would we have to do to get you to spend twice that? Three times that?\" After a few of these customer exercises I understood the average selling price of the sotware and the lifetime value of a customer." , sourceName: "The Four Steps to the Epiphany: Successful Strategies for Products that Win, by Steve Blank", sourceURL: "https://www.amazon.com/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Successful-Strategies/dp/1119690358", doneBool: false, doneKey: "", buyURL: "https://www.amazon.com/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Successful-Strategies/dp/1119690358")

//https://www.ycombinator.com/library/4D-yc-s-essential-startup-advice
/*
When you're looking for space for a startup, don't feel that it has to look professional. Professional means doing good work, not elevators and glass walls. I'd advise most startups to avoid corporate space at first and just rent an apartment. You want to live at the office in a startup, so why not have a place designed to be lived in as your office?

Besides being cheaper and better to work in, apartments tend to be in better locations than office buildings. And for a startup location is very important. The key to productivity is for people to come back to work after dinner. Those hours after the phone stops ringing are by far the best for getting work done. Great things happen when a group of employees go out to dinner together, talk over ideas, and then come back to their offices to implement them. So you want to be in a place where there are a lot of restaurants around, not some dreary office park that's a wasteland after 6:00 PM. Once a company shifts over into the model where everyone drives home to the suburbs for dinner, however late, you've lost something extraordinarily valuable. God help you if you actually start in that mode.

If I were going to start a startup today, there are only three places I'd consider doing it: on the Red Line near Central, Harvard, or Davis Squares (Kendall is too sterile); in Palo Alto on University or California Aves; and in Berkeley immediately north or south of campus. These are the only places I know that have the right kind of vibe.

The most important way to not spend money is by not hiring people. I may be an extremist, but I think hiring people is the worst thing a company can do. To start with, people are a recurring expense, which is the worst kind. They also tend to cause you to grow out of your space, and perhaps even move to the sort of uncool office building that will make your software worse. But worst of all, they slow you down: instead of sticking your head in someone's office and checking out an idea with them, eight people have to have a meeting about it. So the fewer people you can hire, the better. The only reason to hire someone is to do something you'd like to do but can't.

//Should You?


I learned, without realizing it at the time, a lot of valuable lessons about the software business. In this case they were mostly negative lessons: don't have a lot of meetings; don't have chunks of code that multiple people own; don't have a sales guy running the company; don't make a high-end product; don't let your code get too big; don't leave finding bugs to QA people; don't go too long between releases; don't isolate developers from users; don't move from Cambridge to Route 128; and so on. [8] But negative lessons are just as valuable as positive ones. Perhaps even more valuable: it's hard to repeat a brilliant performance, but it's straightforward to avoid errors.

The other reason it's hard to start a company before 23 is that people won't take you seriously. VCs won't trust you, and will try to reduce you to a mascot as a condition of funding. Customers will worry you're going to flake out and leave them stranded. Even you yourself, unless you're very unusual, will feel your age to some degree; you'll find it awkward to be the boss of someone much older than you, and if you're 21, hiring only people younger rather limits your options.

The other cutoff, 38, has a lot more play in it. One reason I put it there is that I don't think many people have the physical stamina much past that age. I used to work till 2:00 or 3:00 AM every night, seven days a week. I don't know if I could do that now.

Also, startups are a big risk financially. If you try something that blows up and leaves you broke at 26, big deal; a lot of 26 year olds are broke. By 38 you can't take so many risks-- especially if you have kids.


During this time you'll do little but work, because when you're not working, your competitors will be. My only leisure activities were running, which I needed to do to keep working anyway, and about fifteen minutes of reading a night. I had a girlfriend for a total of two months during that three year period. Every couple weeks I would take a few hours off to visit a used bookshop or go to a friend's house for dinner. I went to visit my family twice. Otherwise I just worked.

Working was often fun, because the people I worked with were some of my best friends.

/////////////////////
Organic Startup Ideas
https://www.paulgraham.com/organic.html

The best way to come up with startup ideas is to ask yourself the question: what do you wish someone would make for you?

So if you want to start a startup and don't know yet what you're going to do, I'd encourage you to focus initially on organic ideas. What's missing or broken in your daily life? Sometimes if you just ask that question you'll get immediate answers.

The worst ideas we see at Y Combinator are from young founders making things they think other people will want.

So if you want to come up with organic startup ideas, I'd encourage you to focus more on the idea part and less on the startup part. Just fix things that seem broken, regardless of whether it seems like the problem is important enough to build a company on. If you keep pursuing such threads it would be hard not to end up making something of value to a lot of people, and when you do, surprise, you've got a company.

Don't be discouraged if what you produce initially is something other people dismiss as a toy. In fact, that's a good sign. That's probably why everyone else has been overlooking the idea.

If you find something broken that you can fix for a lot of people, you've found a gold mine. As with an actual gold mine, you still have to work hard to get the gold out of it. But at least you know where the seam is, and that's the hard part.

let purpose6 = Tip(header: "Harvard Professor üìù", title: "Figuring out your life's purpose: The type of person you want to become- what is the purpose of your life- is too important to leave to chance. It needs to be deliberately conceived, chosen, and managed.", body: "People who have led movements for change, such as Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, and the Dalai Lama, have had an extraordinarily clear sense of purpose. But the world did not \"deliver\" a cogent and rewarding purpose to them. And, unfortunately, it won't \"deliver\" one to you, either. \n\nUnderstanding the three parts composing the purpose of life- a likeness, a commitment, and a metric- is the most reliable way I know of to define for yourself what your purpose is, and to live it in your life every day. \n\nFinally, please remember that this is a process, not an event. It took me years to fully understand my own purpose. But the journey has been worthwhile. \n\nWith that as background, I will share how I have come to understand my purpose. \n\n1. The likeness- the person I want to become- was the simplest of the three parts, and was largely an intellectual process. Examples include dedicating yourself to helping improve the lives of other people.  \n\n2. Becoming Committed: How do you become so deeply committed to these things that they guide what you prioritize on a daily basis- to drive what you will do, and what you will not do? Each of us may have a different process for committing to our likeness. But what is universal is that your intent must be to answer this question: who do I truly want to become? If you begin to feel that the likeness you have sketched out for yourself is not right- that this is not the person you want to become- then you must revisit your likeness. But if it becomes clear that it is the person you want to become, then you must devote your life to becoming that person. I can recall with perfect clarity the intensity with which I focused on seeking to know if my likeness was right- and then committing to it. As I followed this process, it became clear to me through feelings that I sensed in my heart and words that come into my mind that I had my likeness correct. I saw in my likeness a clarity and magnitude that I had never conceived before. It truly changed my heart and my life. For me, defining the likeness of the person I wanted to become was straightforward. However, being deeply committed to actually becoming this type of person was hard. \n\n3. Finding the Right Metric: The third part of my life's purpose was to understand the metric by which my life will be measured. For me, this took the longest. I came to understand that while many of us might default to measuring our lives by summary statistics, such as number of people presided over, number of awards, or dollars accumulated in a bank, and so on, the only metrics that will truly matter to my life are the individuals whom I have been able to help, one by one, to become better people. When I have my interview with God, our conversation will focus on the individuals whose self-esteem I was able to strengthen, who faith I was able to reinforce, and whose discomfort I was able to assuage- a doer of good, regardless of what assignment I had. These are the metrics that matter in measuring my life. \n\nI promise my students that if they take the time to figure out their life's purpose, they'll look back on it as the most important thing they will ever have discovered. In the long run, clarity about purpose will trump knowledge of any of the key business theories we teach at Harvard.  \n\nWhat's true for them is true for you. If you take time the time to figure out your purpose in life, I promise that you will look back on it as the most important thing you will have ever learned." , sourceName: "How Will You Measure Your Life? by Clayton Christensen", sourceURL: "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006ID0CH4/", doneBool: false, doneKey: "", buyURL: "")
