After many soul-searching hours on the meditation bench in contemplation, my true purpose finally showed itself. It seemed to come from the quiet depths within, like a vision. I believe this is the way it’s supposed to happen. We can’t think our way to our purpose like we might draw up a flowchart. Rather we must listen closely and listen with our whole being. When we are still and listen to the deep-rooted stories that drive our lives, the purpose will reveal itself as a new story, a possible future that may be radically different than the one we find ourselves stewing in. Once revealed we feel compelled to align with it. When we align with our purpose, passion long lost is once again ignited. We feel special, again. \n\n• My purpose is to master myself so I can serve humanity as a warrior, leader and teacher." , sourceName: "SEALFIT", sourceURL: "https://sealfit.com/part-3-uncover-your-purpose-ignite-your-passion/", sponsorLogo: "", sponsorURL: "")

let purpose6 = Tip(header: "Purpose - Harvard Professor", title: "Figuring out your life's purpose:  The type of person you want to become- what the purpose of your life is- is too important to leave to chance. It needs to be deliberately conceived, chosen, and managed.", body: "People who have led movements for change, such as Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, and the Dalai Lama, have had an extraordinarily clear sense of purpose. But the world did not \"deliver\" a cogent and rewarding purpose to them. And, unfortunately, it won't \"deliver\" one to you, either. \n\nUnderstanding the three parts composing the purpose of life- a likeness, a commitment, and a metric- is the most reliable way I know of to define for yourself what your purpose is, and to live it in your life every day. \n\nFinally, please remember that this is a process, not an event. It took me years to fully understand my own purpose. But the journey has been worthwhile. \n\nWith that as background, I will share how I have come to understand my purpose. \n\n1. The likeness- the person I want to become- was the simplest of the three parts, and was largely an intellectual process. Examples include dedicating yourself to helping improve the lives of other people.  \n\n2. Becoming Committed: How do you become so deeply committed to these things that they guide what you prioritize on a daily basis- to drive what you will do, and what you will not do? Each of us may have a different process for committing to our likeness. But what is universal is that your intent must be to answer this question: who do I truly want to become? If you begin to feel that the likeness you have sketched out for yourself is not right- that this is not the person you want to become- then you must revisit your likeness. But if it becomes clear that it is the person you want to become, then you must devote your life to becoming that person. I can recall with perfect clarity the intensity with which I focused on seeking to know if my likeness was right- and then committing to it. As I followed this process, it became clear to me through feelings that I sensed in my heart and words that come into my mind that I had my likeness correct. I saw in my likeness a clarity and magnitude that I had never conceived before. It truly changed my heart and my life. For me, defining the likeness of the person I wanted to become was straightforward. However, being deeply committed to actually becoming this type of person was hard. \n\n3. Finding the Right Metric: The third part of my life's purpose was to understand the metric by which my life will be measured. For me, this took the longest. I came to understand that while many of us might default to measuring our lives by summary statistics, such as number of people presided over, number of awards, or dollars accumulated in a bank, and so on, the only metrics that will truly matter to my life are the individuals whom I have been able to help, one by one, to become better people. When I have my interview with God, our conversation will focus on the individuals whose self-esteem I was able to strengthen, who faith I was able to reinforce, and whose discomfort I was able to assuage- a doer of good, regardless of what assignment I had. These are the metrics that matter in measuring my life. \n\nI promise my students that if they take the time to figure out their life's purpose, they'll look back on it as the most important thing they will ever have discovered. In the long run, clarity about purpose will trump knowledge of any of the key business theories we teach at Harvard.  \n\nWhat's true for them is true for you. If you take time the time to figure out your purpose in life, I promise that you will look back on it as the most important thing you will have ever learned." , sourceName: "How Will You Measure Your Life?", sourceURL: "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006ID0CH4/", sponsorLogo: "", sponsorURL: "")

Because what happens is that the world shifts itself around your aim. Let's say your aim is the highest possible aim. So, that sets up the world around you. It organizes all of your perceptions. It organizes what you see and what you don't see. It organizes your emotions and motivations. So, then you organize yourself around that aim. And then what happens is the day manifests itself as a set of challenges and problems. And if you solve them properly then you stay on the pathway towards that aim. And you can concentrate on the day. And it seems to me that that is what makes every moment of the day supercharged with meaning.
