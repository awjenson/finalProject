# iOS Nanodegree Final Project

The goal of the app is to help people make smarter decisions, more quickly, by providing them with the right information at the right time.

Information researched, summarized, and presented to the user based on the day and time.  The second section profiles a famous persion (artist, activist, athlete, entreprenuer, etc.) each day and provides a summary of their advice related to several life topics.  Below each topic, the user can input and store their own information.  The third section consists of a personal journal and a tracker of their daily habits.  This helps to develop the user's self-awareness.
